# Yebot but in go

Yebot, in Node.JS, was a fun, utility and random bot that could do cards and things like that.
It had a music functionnality and it was pretty laggy.

# Music

The music system has been revamped and is now working.
A queue system is being added and works pretty well.
I will add more queue functionalities in the future of course.

# Random Stuff

It can still do random stuff like minecraft-like success.
It can also repeat what you say.
Or even give you a random meme.

# Games

It also has two mini games at the moment.
It has a Tic Tac Toe.

And it has a Hang Man.
