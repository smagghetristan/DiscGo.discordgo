# Yebot but in go

- Yebot, in Node.JS, was a fun, utility and random bot that could do cards and things like that.
- It had a music functionnality and it was pretty laggy.

# Music

- The music system has been revamped and is now working.
- A queue system is being added and works pretty well.
- I will add more queue functionalities in the future of course.

# Random Stuff

- It can still do random stuff like minecraft-like success.
- It can also repeat what you say.
- Or even give you a random meme.

# Games

- It also has two mini games at the moment.
- It has a Tic Tac Toe.
